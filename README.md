=================
This project aims at importing and consolidating bioinformatics tool descriptions from a number of tools metadata resources, so that they can be synchronised with tools registries, catalogues, or integrated frameworks (primarily the global generic BMB/ELIXIR tools registry). The resources in focus of this pilot attempt may include:
- mobyle
- gensoft
- emboss
- galaxy
- seqwiki
- debian-med
and sooner or later also the global generic tools registry developed with the support from BioMedBridges and ELIXIR.
