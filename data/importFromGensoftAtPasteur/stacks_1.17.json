    "description": "Stacks is designed to work with any restriction-enzyme based data, such as GBS, CRoPS, and both single and double digest RAD. Stacks is designed as a modular pipeline to efficiently curate and assemble large numbers of short-read sequences from multiple samples. Stacks identifies loci in a set of individuals, either de novo or aligned to a reference genome (including gapped alignments), and then genotypes each locus"
