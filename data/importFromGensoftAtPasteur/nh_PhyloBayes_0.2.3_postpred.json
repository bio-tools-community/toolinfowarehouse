    "description": "Models for phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogenetic models 'BP' (Blanquart and Lartillot 2006) and 'CAT+BP' (Blanquart and Lartillot 2008) implement non-stationary and non-homogeneous stochastic processes for both amino-acid and nucleotide substitutions. Both the models allow to fit global compositional variations along the phylogenetic tree branches, and CAT+BP moreover implements the CAT model component (Lartillot and Philippe 2004) estimating a mixture of site specific substitution processes. Those models are implemented into the NH_PhyloBayes package for phylogenetic reconstruction."
