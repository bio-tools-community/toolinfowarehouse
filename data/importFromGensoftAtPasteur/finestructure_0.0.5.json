    "description": "a fast and powerful algorithm for identifying population structure using dense sequencing data. By using the output of ChromoPainter as a (nearly) sufficient summary statistic, it is able to perform model-based Bayesian clustering on large datasets, including full resequencing data, and can handle up to 1000s of individuals. Full assignment uncertainty is given."
