    "description": "a de novo probabilistic measure of assembly quality which allows an objective comparison of multiple assemblies generated from a same set of reads. Specifically, we define the quality of an assembly as the conditional probability of the sequenced reads given the sequence output by the assembler, value maximized by the true genome sequence."
